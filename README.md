# Shopify onboarding UI

This project is a simple reproduction of the Shopify onboarding UI build with
single `index.html`, `app.css`, and `app.js` files. I initially started the
project to participate in the [Level Up Front Hackathon
2023](https://www.crushingit.tech/hackathon). The challenge was to recreate the
design and functionality of the Shopify onboarding page and a Figma file was
provided, but I could not finish the project before the deadline. However, I
completed it, as it was so much fun. This repo contains all the code and some
other files I used as my thinking board ðŸ˜‰.

## Structure

The `~/src` directory contains the source code for the project and other related
files. The three main files of the project, `index.html`, `app.css`, and
`app.js` are at the root of this directory. Other related files are nested in
it. These are outlined below.

- `~/src/__ref`: contains related files, but they're not necessarily needed to
  run the project. This directory also contains the Figma file provided for the
  hackathon challenge.
- `~/src/__images`: contains the images which are referenced from the
  `index.html` file. Although these images are hosted on the hackathon website,
  including them in the project makes sense to avoid unnecessary external
  dependency, as the hackathon host might take those down in the future.
